# YOLOv8

YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once Version 8) is a deep learning model for object detection, and it represents the latest iteration in the YOLO (You Only Look Once) series. YOLOv8 is capable of simultaneously detecting multiple objects within an image in a single forward pass and provides bounding boxes and class labels for each detected object.

## Key Features

- **Real-time Object Detection**: YOLOv8 is a real-time object detection model capable of simultaneously identifying multiple objects in an image in a single forward pass. This makes it highly useful for applications requiring efficient processing.

- **Multi-scale Detection**: YOLOv8 employs different-scale feature maps to detect objects of varying sizes, enhancing its ability to handle objects of various dimensions and improving detection accuracy.
 
- **Robust Post-processing**: YOLOv8 utilizes a series of post-processing techniques, including Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) and threshold filtering, to eliminate overlapping detection boxes and filter out detections with low confidence scores.

- **Support for Multiple Datasets**: YOLOv8 can be applied to various types of datasets and can be fine-tuned to adapt to different application scenarios.

## Cases

- **Object Detection**: YOLOv8 is commonly used for object detection tasks such as traffic monitoring, facial recognition, industrial inspection, and more.

- **Autonomous Driving**: YOLOv8 can be applied to object and pedestrian detection in autonomous driving, assisting vehicles in identifying obstacles in their surroundings.

- **Security Surveillance**: YOLOv8 finds applications in security surveillance, helping monitor human traffic, vehicles, and other objects.

## Learning Resources

You can gain a deeper understanding of how YOLOv8 works and how to use it by studying related research papers, exploring open-source code repositories, and participating in online courses related to deep learning.

## Using Python with Ultralytics.

[Ultralytics](https://www.ultralytics.com/) It is an open-source deep learning research framework designed to provide easy-to-use tools to assist developers in tasks such as object detection, image classification, and semantic segmentation. Here, we provide a brief introduction and usage guide for Ultralytics.

## Object Detection Models

Ultralytics is an open-source deep learning research framework designed to offer user-friendly tools for developers working on tasks like object detection, image classification, and semantic segmentation. Here is a brief introduction and guide on how to use Ultralytics.

```python
from ultralytics import YOLO

# Load a model
model = YOLO('yolov8n.pt')  # pretrained YOLOv8n model

# Run batched inference on a list of images
results = model(['im1.jpg', 'im2.jpg'])  # return a list of Results objects

# Process results list
for result in results:
    boxes = result.boxes  # Boxes object for bbox outputs
    masks = result.masks  # Masks object for segmentation masks outputs
    keypoints = result.keypoints  # Keypoints object for pose outputs
    probs = result.probs  # Probs object for classification outputs
```
This example demonstrates the basic steps of performing object detection using the YOLOv5 model, including initializing the model, loading an image, executing object detection, and displaying the prediction results on the image. With the tools provided by Ultralytics, developers can conduct object detection tasks more conveniently and make model adjustments and result visualizations as needed.
